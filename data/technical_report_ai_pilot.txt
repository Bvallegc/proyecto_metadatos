TECHNICAL REPORT – AI Document Intelligence Pilot

Overview:
The objective of this pilot is to evaluate the performance of a semantic search pipeline based on ChromaDB and LangChain.

System Architecture:
Documents are ingested through an ETL process, vectorized using OpenAI embeddings, and stored in Chroma for contextual retrieval.

Results:
- Average retrieval latency: 250ms per query.
- Metadata accuracy after LLM enrichment: 91%.
- Average cost per 1K documents processed: $0.38.

Recommendations:
Further tuning of embedding models and exploration of hybrid retrieval techniques (BM25 + dense embeddings).
